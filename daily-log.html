<h1>Round 2 Day 63 of #100DaysOfCode</h1>

<p>Worked more on the La Pizzeria theme in the Professional WordPress Theme Development from Scratch course with @JuanDevWP. After installing Modernizr, I ran into some issues with the column layout on the pages and after fixing that had some more column issues. Modernizr does not play nice with teh [class="column"] tag. I took it ourt and added the CSS to the individual column areas. I also had another reminder that the WordPress command in wp_enqueue_script not wp_enqueue_scripts. I also noticed that the second one also creates a JS error inside Google mapps but does not disable Google Maps. Lots more to come tomorrow.</p>

<h1>Round 2 Day 62 of #100DaysOfCode</h1>
<p>Today I did soemthing kind of crazy and added the most recent entry to the top so people can find them better. I also got back into the rofessional WordxPress Theme Development with Juan Pablo. Only 25 short videos to go and I will have completed tanother course and on my way to getting better gigs and making more money. I am so looking forward to that. It will be so very exciting once that happens. I still need to get expert level in WordPress, PHP, React and more. It's also very exciting that I am updating this in GitHub now.  </p>


<h1>Day 25</h1>

<h1>Round 2 Day 31</h1>

<p>Worked on the new WordPress site writing HtML, and CSS for a Beaver BUilder build. Beaver Build is a
great drop-and-drag editor but to build custom websites with it, you still have to know how to code.</p>

<p>Also got back into the Git a New Job course with Brad Schiff (@learnwebcode on Twitter) and made some 
progress with Waypoints and jQuery making elements fade in and out. It was not using the fadeIn or fadeOut 
methods from jQuery but using opacities and transitioning these opacities using CSS.</p>

That's Round 2 Day 31 of 100 Days of Code

<h1>Round 2 Day 33</h2>

<p>Today I worked a little more on a WordPress build for a client who wants to transfer her client sites to 
Beaver Builder for improved page loading speed and therefore ranking. I've never read that BB sites load 
faster, but it's worth a shot. I still don't believe that page loading speed plays that critical of a role in ranking.
I still think that content and frequency of adding content are still the top dogs. Turned down two projects 
because they lacked client commitment, financially and in planning. If someone tells me they are cheap from the
beginning, I just neeed to say "I've go tot go." Worked a little more onn the site build to show how HTML, CSS, 
Git, gitHub and Gulp work in the course with Brad Schiff. Looking forward to getting into some more JS, 
React or Node.js. Full Stack and MEAN Stack are calling my name. So is Laravel. More to come tomorrow.</p>

<h1>Round 2 Day 61</h1>
<p>Today I got back into the wordPress Themes from Scratch Course with Juan Pablo de la torre Valdez. I am so looking forward to getting back into the WordPress plugin course and getting a better handle on PHP as it pertains to WordPress. I'm not sure if the WordPress thing is still a viable buisness offering but if I'm one of the only ones who understand and can customize Gutenberg, I stand a better chance.</p>
