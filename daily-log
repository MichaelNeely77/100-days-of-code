<h1>Day 25</h1>

<h1>Round 2 Day 31</h1>

<p>Worked on the new WordPress site writing HtML, and CSS for a Beaver BUilder build. Beaver Build is a
great drop-and-drag editor but to build custom websites with it, you still have to know how to code.</p>

<p>Also got back into the Git a New Job course with Brad Schiff (@learnwebcode on Twitter) and made some 
progress with Waypoints and jQuery making elements fade in and out. It was not using the fadeIn or fadeOut 
methods from jQuery but using opacities and transitioning these opacities using CSS.</p>
