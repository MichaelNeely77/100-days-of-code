<h1>Day 25</h1>

<h1>Round 2 Day 31</h1>

<p>Worked on the new WordPress site writing HtML, and CSS for a Beaver BUilder build. Beaver Build is a
great drop-and-drag editor but to build custom websites with it, you still have to know how to code.</p>

<p>Also got back into the Git a New Job course with Brad Schiff (@learnwebcode on Twitter) and made some 
progress with Waypoints and jQuery making elements fade in and out. It was not using the fadeIn or fadeOut 
methods from jQuery but using opacities and transitioning these opacities using CSS.</p>

That's Round 2 Day 31 of 100 Days of Code

<h1>Round 2 Day 33</h2>

<p>Today I worked a little more on a WordPress build for a client who wants to transfer her client sites to 
Beaver Builder for improved page loading speed and therefore ranking. I've never read that BB sites load 
faster, but it's worth a shot. I still don't believe that page loading speed plays that critical of a role in ranking.
I still think that content and frequency of adding content are still the top dogs. Turned down two projects 
because they lacked client commitment, financially and in planning. If someone tells me they are cheap from the
beginning, I just neeed to say "I've go tot go." Worked a little more onn the site build to show how HTML, CSS, 
Git, gitHub and Gulp work in the course with Brad Schiff. Looking forward to getting into some more JS, 
React or Node.js. Full Stack and MEAN Stack are calling my name. So is Laravel. More to come tomorrow.</p>
